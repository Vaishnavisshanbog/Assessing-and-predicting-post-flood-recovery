<h1>Creating AI frameworks for assessing and predicting post-flood recovery</h1>

<p>The project uses a Random Forest Classifier for flood prediction and provides recovery assessments based on factors like recovery funds, infrastructure damage, and population affectedBy harnessing advanced AI capabilities, this framework not only anticipates flood occurrences but also evaluates the potential impact on affected regions. This proactive approach empowers decision-makers to prioritize preemptive measures and allocate resources effectively, thereby mitigating the adverse consequences of floods and expediting recovery processes for affected communities.</p>
